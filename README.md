# week2-challenge

#Description
This challenge did not provide any code and the purpose of the challenge was to create a portfolio. The HTML was created with sections to include about me, my work, and contact info. This is not the final portfolio, as during the progression of class I will be able to create a more streamlined look with a more user friendly website. As of now, the image, about me, and contact information is placeholder text and will be updated once bootcamp is complete.
